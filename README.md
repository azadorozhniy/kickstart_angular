Kickstart Angular
=================

It was designed as simple project for me personal website with
robust functionality enabled by super powerful Angular.
Here I'm going to create back-end on Scala to bring data form
social profiles (Github, Bitbucket, StackOverflow, Twitter) dynamically

This project is designed for quick boostraping of new Angular project Requirejs,
